# 3D-Orbital-Mapping
Maps an orbit in 3D space around the celestial body of your choosing based on inputted orbital parameters

Remember to install the correct Libraries in the code
To input the parameters you do it in the terminal then after a matplotlib 3D plot will appear with the planet and orbit (Note: the planets dont have textures just are the correct diameter)
